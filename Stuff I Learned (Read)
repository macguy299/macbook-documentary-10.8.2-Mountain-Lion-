I'm currently writing this on a mac and there are stuff I learned. Why did they discontinue it? There was no reason. It was great. Im planning on working a way to make atleast some things available
so people can enjoy it. Theres some things that are still working like some few websites on safari. I saw some things on that a browser called WaterFox still work, but I have yet to test it out because
I am currently in school. I wish that gamecenter was still up, and I will definitly work on trying to get that back first because I have it linked to my phone and nothing will work even with that being
linked to my phone. 


Theres nothing I can really do about safari besides try and link a proxy with it or see if anyone else has made a boot so it will work again, for example, by burning it to a hard drive and downloading
a bootloader or something like that. But all in all, I think this will be a fun project to document, and to see what I find. \\
